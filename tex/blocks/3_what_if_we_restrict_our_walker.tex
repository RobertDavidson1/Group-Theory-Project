The question arises: what if instead of allowing our walker to walk on the entire integer number line, we restrict them to walking on a finite set of $n$ positions, where moving past the end brings the walker back to the beginning?

More specifically, we want to walk on the finite cyclic abelian group:
$$\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0,1,2,3,\dots,n-1\}$$
with group operation addition modulo $n$. This group satisfies the group axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Closed and Associative} $\hspace{1.75cm}\Rightarrow a + (b+c) \equiv (a+b) + c \mod n \in \mathbb{Z}_n, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_n$
    \item \textbf{Identity} $e = 0 \hspace{5.5cm}\Rightarrow a + 0 \equiv 0 +a \equiv a \mod n\quad a\in\mathbb{Z}_n$
    \item \textbf{Inverse} $a^{-1} = (-a \mod n) \hspace{0.5cm}\Rightarrow a + (-a) \equiv 0 \mod n \quad a \in\mathbb{Z}_n$
\end{itemize}
The element $1$ still acts as a generator, with $-1$ as its inverse, so the generating set remains the same. Our walk, starting again at $e = 0$, after $t$ steps is given by:
$$P_t = \sum_{i=1}^t s_i \mod n \quad s_i \in S$$
Since we've restricted our walker to a finite set of $n$ positions, we might assume that after many steps, with many walkers, each position should be visited equally often and that the distribution of final positions should be uniform. \\[1ex]
However, this isn't the case, even in this simple group, the group's structure constrains where the walker can be. 

As we see below, the walkers' final positions can only reach a uniform distribution for odd $n$ (right histogram), and for even $n$, they can only occupy half of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ (left histogram).
